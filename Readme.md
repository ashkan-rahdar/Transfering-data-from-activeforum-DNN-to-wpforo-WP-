# DotNetNuke (DNN) to WordPress wpForo Migration

## Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide and all necessary files for migrating data from a DotNetNuke (DNN) forum (ActiveForum) to a WordPress site running the wpForo plugin. The migration process includes creating tables in SQL Server, transferring data to MySQL, and integrating data with wpForo. The guide assumes familiarity with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and MySQL.

## Project Structure
- **1.SSMS**: SQL scripts for creating wpForo-compatible tables in SSMS.
- **2.MySQL**: SQL scripts for merging the transferred ActiveForum data with your wpForo installation.

## Setup Steps
[Guide to Transfer tables from SSMS to MySQL and merge them](0.Documentation/2%20%20Transfering%20data%20from%20DNN%20activeForum%20to%20WpForo.md)
1. **Preparing Tables in SSMS**:   
   Run the scripts in the **1.SSMS** folder to create tables matching the wpForo format. This step assumes your DNN database is named **Simorgh975**.

2. **Migrating Data to MySQL**: 
   This document (coming soon) will guide you through using the MySQL Migration Wizard to transfer the data to MySQL.

3. **Merging Data with wpForo**:
   Run the scripts in the **2.MySQL** folder to combine the ActiveForum data into wpForoâ€™s tables.
