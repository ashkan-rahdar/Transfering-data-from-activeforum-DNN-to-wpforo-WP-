After compeleting 0.0 you should install WP and MySQL:

## Install MySQL

1. Download MySQL:
    - Go to the [MySQL Community Downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and download the MySQL Installer for Windows.

2. Run MySQL Installer:
    - Follow the installation wizard, selecting the appropriate options.
    - Choose the Server only setup type unless you need other tools.
    - Configure your MySQL server (set the root password and create any additional users if needed).
    - ensure install MySQL Workbench

3. Finish Installation:
    - Complete the installation and start the MySQL server.

4. Test MySQL Installation:
    - Open MySQL Workbench or MySQL Command Line Client and log in with the root credentials to ensure everything is working correctly.
5. Creat your Schema:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE yourdbname;
```


## Basic WP installation

1. Download WordPress
    - Click the [Download WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/) button to get the latest version in a ZIP file.

2. Extract WordPress Files

    - Extract the ZIP file:
        - Locate the downloaded ZIP file (usually in your Downloads folder).
        - Right-click the file and select Extract All.
        - Extract the contents to a folder (e.g., C:\WordPress).

    - Move WordPress Files:
        - Copy the contents of the extracted WordPress folder.
        - Paste them into the IIS root directory: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\yourwordpresssite (you may need to create a new folder for your WordPress site).

3. Configure WordPress

    - Rename the Configuration File:
        - In the C:\inetpub\wwwroot\yourwordpresssite folder, find the file named wp-config-sample.php.
        - Rename it to wp-config.php.

    - Edit wp-config.php:
        - Open wp-config.php in a text editor (e.g., Notepad).
        - Locate the following lines and update them with your database information:

        ```php
        // ** MySQL settings ** //
        /** The name of the database for WordPress */
        define('DB_NAME', 'yourdbname');

        /** MySQL database username */
        define('DB_USER', 'yourusername');

        /** MySQL database password */
        define('DB_PASSWORD', 'yourpassword');

        /** MySQL hostname */
        define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
        ```
        Save and close the file.

* $${\color{red}IMPORTANT}$$: During the initial setup of WordPress, creating tables in the database and configuring directories requires write permissions. I highly recommend granting full control permissions temporarily to facilitate a smooth setup process. Once the installation is complete, you can reduce permissions to Read & Execute, List Folder Contents, and Read to enhance security.

If these permissions are not set correctly during setup, you may encounter the following error:
```
WordPress database error Table ********* doesn't exist for query INSERT INTO `wp_options` (`option_name`, `option_value`, `autoload`) VALUES ('nonce_key', '}*********  G(*********) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `option_name` = VALUES(`option_name`), `option_value` = VALUES(`option_value`), `autoload` = VALUES(`autoload`) made by wp_can_install_language_pack, WP_Upgrader->fs_connect, Automatic_Upgrader_Skin->request_filesystem_credentials, WP_Upgrader_Skin->request_filesystem_credentials, request_filesystem_credentials, wp_nonce_field, wp_create_nonce, wp_hash, wp_salt, update_site_option, update_network_option, add_network_option, add_option

```

4. Set Up IIS for WordPress

    - Create a New Site in IIS (optional if you created a folder directly under wwwroot):
        - Open IIS Manager.
        - In the Connections pane, right-click on Sites and select Add Website.
        - Fill in the following details:
            - Site name: YourWordPressSite
            - Physical path: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\yourwordpresssite
            - Binding: Set the port (default is 80 for HTTP) and hostname (if needed).
        - Click OK.

    - Configure Permissions:
        - Right-click on your WordPress folder (C:\inetpub\wwwroot\yourwordpresssite).
        - Go to Properties > Security.
        - Ensure that IIS_IUSRS has Read & Execute, List folder contents, and Read permissions.

5. Complete the WordPress Installation

    - Access Your WordPress Site:
        - Open a web browser and go to http://localhost/yourwordpresssite (or the hostname you configured).

    - Follow the Installation Wizard:
        - Select your language and click Continue.
        - Fill in your site title, username, password, and email address.
        - Click Install WordPress.
