# Wpforo Setup

In this documentation, I will try to explain how to setup your WpForo while my Wpforo version is 2.4.0 and my WP version is 6.6.2


## Basic Of Wpforo

After installing wpForo, WordPress will automatically create a page called **Forum**. This page is ready to display your forum with wpForo. To show the forum on any page, simply add [wpforo] in a block, and the forum will appear.

For more customization options, go to wpForo Settings in your dashboard. We’ll cover these settings in the next steps. As you can see in picture below:

## Fixing the 404 Error in wpForo

If you encounter a 404 error when clicking on any wpForo section, it’s likely due to a conflict between your `web.config` file and wpForo’s default settings.

- Problem Description:  
When this error occurs, you’ll see "index.php" included in the URL (e.g., `yourwebsite/index.php/community`). This extra “index.php” is causing the issue.

- Solution:

1. Edit the `web.config` File:
   - Open the `web.config` file located in the root folder of your website.
   - Add the following code to enable URL rewriting:

   ```xml
   <rewrite>
       <rules>
           <rule name="WordPress Rule" stopProcessing="true">
               <match url=".*" />
               <conditions>
                   <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
                   <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
               </conditions>
               <action type="Rewrite" url="index.php/{R:0}" />
           </rule>
       </rules>
   </rewrite>
   ```

2. Install URL Rewrite Module on IIS:
   - If you don’t already have the rewrite module installed on IIS, download and install it using these links:
     - [Rewrite for 64-bit](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/2/8/128E2E22-C1B9-44A4-BE2A-5859ED1D4592/rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi)
     - [Rewrite for 32-bit](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/8/1/D81E5DD6-1ABB-46B0-9B4B-21894E18B77F/rewrite_x86_en-US.msi)

This should resolve the 404 error and ensure wpForo works correctly on your site.
